As multiple AI platforms are expanding, like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot, each brings unique strengths. However, users often struggle to see all their options or compare them easily. Right now, using multiple platforms means typing the same prompt over and over and switching between platforms, which can be slow and frustrating.

To solve this, we're creating a platform that gathers responses from different AI models in one place. With this tool, users can type a single prompt and see responses from multiple AIs side by side. They can then quickly pick the best response and click through to that platform to continue.

This platform will make it simple to explore, compare, and use the best of what each AI has to offer. It saves users time and helps them make more informed choices across AI options.
